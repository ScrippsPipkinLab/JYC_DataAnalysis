	Using Custom Genome
	Peak file = BCL6_TFHpeaklist_sorted_sc.bed
	Genome = genome.fa
	Organism = unknown
	Motif files:
		/gpfs/home/hdiao/homer/data/knownTFs/all/known.motifs	-m
	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 10979
		peakfile formatted lines: 0
		Duplicated Peak IDs: 53

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 10979
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!
