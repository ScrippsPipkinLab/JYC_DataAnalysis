	Peak/BED file conversion summary:
		BED/Header formatted lines: 100000
		peakfile formatted lines: 0
		Duplicated Peak IDs: 0

	Peak File Statistics:
		Total Peaks: 100000
		Redundant Peak IDs: 0
		Peaks lacking information: 0 (need at least 5 columns per peak)
		Peaks with misformatted coordinates: 0 (should be integer)
		Peaks with misformatted strand: 0 (should be either +/- or 0/1)

	Peak file looks good!
